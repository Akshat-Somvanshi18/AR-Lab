# AR Lab

AR Lab is an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to transform traditional learning into a more interactive, engaging, and fun experience for kids. By integrating AR technology, this project allows children to explore and learn through 3D models, interactive sounds, and games, making education an immersive experience.

## Features

### Learning Modules
1. **Alphabet Learning**:
   - View 3D models of alphabets using AR markers.
   - Hear the pronunciation of each alphabet for better learning.

2. **Shapes Learning**:
   - Display 3D models of various shapes.
   - Understand shapes through visual and auditory cues.

3. **Solar System Learning**:
   - Explore 3D models of planets.
   - Learn interesting facts and sounds related to the solar system.

4. **Guess Game**:
   - Interactive game to guess objects displayed in 3D.
   - Improves critical thinking and learning.

### Marker-Based AR
- Utilizes **barcode markers** and **pattern markers** to trigger 3D models and sounds.
- Markers can be downloaded from the **Download Marker** page.

### Interactive Elements
- Sounds powered by **Howler.js**.
- Seamless camera integration for AR experiences.

### User-Friendly Interface
- **Landing Page**: Provides an overview of the app.
