# AR Lab

AR Lab is an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to transform traditional learning into a more interactive, engaging, and fun experience for kids. By integrating AR technology, this project allows children to explore and learn through 3D models, interactive sounds, and games, making education an immersive experience.

## Features

### Learning Modules
1. **Alphabet Learning**:
   - View 3D models of alphabets using AR markers.
   - Hear the pronunciation of each alphabet for better learning.

2. **Shapes Learning**:
   - Display video tutorials of various shapes.
   - Understand shapes through visual and auditory cues.

3. **Solar System Learning**:
   - Explore 3D models of planets.

4. **Guess Game**:
   - Interactive game to guess objects by hearing its sound within a time range.
   - Improves critical thinking and learning.

### Marker-Based AR
